            Welcome to Whimsy Cafe! We currently host bimonthly events that feature a new menu each
            time. The goal of each event is to create a welcoming space where people can hang out
            and enjoy a nice cup of tea, a delicious pastry, and a conversation with friends. Our
            next event is scheduled for June 29th. If you are interested in attending, please RSVP.
